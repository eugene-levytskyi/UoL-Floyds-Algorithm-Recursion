## Project

Implementation of Floyd Warshallâ€™s algorithm using recursion.


## Project Description

The project implements Floyd's algorithm to compute the shortest distance
between all pairs of nodes in a graph.

It provides a function called floyd(), which takes in a square matrix
representing the graph and returns a square matrix representing the shortest
distance between all pairs of nodes in the graph.
